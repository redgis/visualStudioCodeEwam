# Visual Studio Code Ewam

This repo is a work in progress as Visual Studio Code is still in Beta by Microsoft.
This plugin leverage the eWam API to let you edit eWam Code With Visual Studio Code.


## Take a tour...
![eWam VSC](tour.gif)

## Requirements
* Visual Studio Code
* [Advanced Framework](https://github.com/MphasisWyde/ewam-advanced-framework)
* [ModelAPI v1](https://github.com/MphasisWyde/WydeActiveModelerAPI)

## Installation (Dev mode)
* Clone this repo
* Run `npm install`
* Run 

## Get up and running straight away (Debug mode)
* press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded
* run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `F1`) and typing `ewam`
* set breakpoints in `extension.ts` to debug the extension
* find output from your extension in the debug console

# Roadmap

## Upcoming tasks

- [ ] Forbid Class/module checkout/modification for dependencies <= maybe, useless since dependencies are checked in (and should be kept by integrator), thus in readonly  
- [ ] Class/module documentation with more info : variables/methodes/types/constantes/scenarios
- [ ] Class tree as HTML preview
- [ ] Module list as HTML preview
- [ ] When opening a class/module, fold anotations
- [ ] Provide custom syntax theme base on "Dark (Visual Studio)" theme. 
- [ ] "Open eWam" command
- [ ] Handle "rebundling" (moving a project entity from its current bundle to a new one)

- [ ] Ergonomic way to override variables and methods
- [ ] Additional validations (check repo is writable)
- [ ] Other entity management (create new scenario, translation, ...)
- [ ] Verify compatibility 6.1 / 6.1.5 (test multi user) - seb
- [ ] Demo video (with OBS - https://obsproject.com/download)

- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] Integrator documentation / guidelines
    - Preparation de l’env VS Code
    - Installation de nouveaux bundles tiers
    - MAJ de bundles tiers
    - Prise en compte des nouvelles classes de developeurs
    - Bundle redesign

- Bug fixes and ergonomy
    - [ ] Unable to open Reimplems : reimplems disabled (actually there's more to it, c.f. commenting InitReimplemExecution() isn't enought... ) 
    - [ ] API performance (i.e. GetMetaInfo : 10s to get metainfo of aWFActor when AdvancedComponents not compiled, due to serializer)
        - use Florian's serializer for simple records
        - maybe cache metainfo in local file
   - [ ] Improve "Find references" feature to provide position in file (use metainfo or maybe ewam-open:// URL ?)
      - [ ] Explore ewam-open:// scheme handling with contentProviders, to lazy-load gold modules from URLs (might be useful in documentation or when accessing an entity we don't know the position yet)
   ... nothing left to do... we're nearly there !
   - [ ] Add watch on bundleIndex.json ?

## 2.0 supported as of eWAM 6.2

- [ ] API re-fectoring
    - [ ] APIs redesign : API restful (see swapi collections)
    - [ ] Review APIs to use IsValid when necessary (checks entity is valid. Usefull when creating a new module / class to check if doesn't exist and name correct)
    - [ ] Implement better outlining / metainfo production API
        - [ ] Outlines and definitions should be provided after F7 parse
    - [ ] API proper and accurate documentation
    - [ ] API test

- [ ] Code re-fectoring / architecturing / documentation
    - [ ] Implement module management (open, save, parse, status update, etc).
    - [ ] Implement metainfo query API
    - [ ] Implement entity access management : local file + synchronization questions  

- [ ] Breakpoint management
- [ ] Debugger
- [ ] Cache management

- [ ] Improve "Find references" feature to provide position in file (use metainfo or maybe ewam-open:// URL ?)
    - [ ] Explore ewam-open:// scheme handling with contentProviders, to lazy-load gold modules from URLs (might be useful in documentation or when accessing an entity we don't know the position yet).


## Possible improvements 

- [ ] Parsing errors iteration 2 : code analyzer feedback
- [ ] Review "Code Actions" feature : could be implemented using code analyzer
- [ ] Add watch on bundleIndex.json in order to detect bundle changes
